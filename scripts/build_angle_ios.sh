# Build ANGLE (EGL + GLES over Metal) for iOS arm64.
#
# This is the host-side GPU stack Husk needs. virglrenderer turns the guest's
# GL calls into real draw calls, but it needs an EGL/GLES implementation to make
# them against -- and iOS has no EGL at all. ANGLE supplies one on top of Metal.
# UTM does the same thing, which is what makes GPU acceleration inside a QEMU
# guest on iOS a solved problem rather than a hope.
#
# ANGLE is taken from WebKit rather than upstream because WebKit carries an
# Xcode project for it, which avoids needing depot_tools and gn. A blob-filtered
# sparse checkout keeps that to ~260 MB instead of cloning all of WebKit.

# Two overrides worth explaining.
#
# WK_AVAILABILITY_OVERLAY_FLAGS points at a clang VFS overlay that WebKit
# generates to defuse availability annotations. Nothing in this subset of the
# tree generates it, so the build dies looking for availability-overlay.yaml.
# Clearing the flag drops the overlay -- which then surfaces the errors it was
# hiding, all of the form "MTLPixelFormatBC1_RGBA is only available on iOS
# 16.4". Those are enum constants, harmless to compile in; the one call that
# matters, supportsBCTextureCompression, sits behind @available, so the warning
# is turned off rather than the target raised. Husk deploys to 15.5 (TrollStore
# and Dopamine devices), and ANGLE is built to match.

# Two passes, because of a name mismatch.
#
# WebKit builds ANGLE with its entry points renamed -- the dylib exports
# EGL_ChooseConfig, not eglChooseConfig -- since WebCore reaches them through
# ANGLE's own loader. libepoxy and virglrenderer expect the standard names.
# Rather than hand-write ~115 forwarding functions, the second pass relinks with
# ld's -alias_list, which adds the standard name as an alias of each renamed
# symbol. No wrappers, no extra indirection at call time.
#
# EGL only, deliberately. Aliasing the 828 GL_* exports the same way fails with
# "ld: 828 duplicate symbols" -- ANGLE already carries internal gl* symbols that
# the aliases collide with. It is also unnecessary: epoxy resolves GL entry
# points through eglGetProcAddress, so EGL is the only surface that must be
# reachable by its standard name.
